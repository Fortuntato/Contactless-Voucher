# Contactless Loyalty
 Final Year Project 2019/2020

Abstract
This project aims to resolve the issue of the many loyalty cards that one person usually hold. A research about the alternative digital solution is carried out to define what can be developed as a new feature not yet in the market. Based upon a statistical approach and a real case business scenario a solution is provided with the Web-NFC API. 
The solution takes into account the budgeting and different limitation of small brands. The target of the service can be considered as the retailers in the small shops. The use of the NFC technology gives a higher level of engagement between the retailer and the customer. At the end of this project, the software developed gives the opportunity for the customer to engage with the retailer. From the retailer point of the view, the web application implemented for this beta version does not meet all the necessary requirements.
