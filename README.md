# Contactless Loyalty
 Final Year Project 2019/2020

This project aims to resolve the problem of the physical loyalty cards either made of paper or plastic. 

A research about the alternative digital solution is carried out to define what can be developed as a new service not yet in the market. Based upon a statistical approach and a real case business scenario a solution is provided with the Web-NFC API, which is different from the current mobile applications. The solution takes into account the budgets and the different limitations of small brands. 

The target audience of the service can be considered as the retailers in the small shops because they would make available the service for the customers. The feedback received from the testers describe a higher level of engagement between the retailer and the customer. 

At the end of this project, the software developed gives the opportunity for the customer to engage with the retailer. From the retailer point of the view, the web application implemented for this beta version does not meet all the requirements although it gives the essentials functionalities.
